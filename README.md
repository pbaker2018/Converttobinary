# Convert to Binary

A basic one-page Android app, using Kotlin.

The user types in a whole number (an integer) and then clicks on the button: 'convert to binary'. 

The app will then work out the conversion and display the result.

The user can clear the result, if they wish, and start again.

If the user clicks on the button: 'convert to binary' without first entering a number, an error message (toast) will appear.
If the user clicks on the button: 'clear' when the results field is already empty, an error message (toast) will appear.
